# If you donâ€™t want characters prefaced by \ to be interpreted as special characters,
# you can use raw strings by adding an r before the first quote

# In below line \n means newline!
print('C:\some\name')

# Note the r before the quote to supress \n meaning i.e special charecter meaning
print(r'C:\some\name')
